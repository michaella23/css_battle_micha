            <p>When I first saw this, I thought I was in trouble! That's a funky shape. But as I looked at it for a
                little while, I realized it was two rectangles, each with one rounded corner at opposite angles of each
                other. Then a little circle with a border for the eye. Writing the code didn't take terribly long, but I
                could <em>not</em> get this pixel perfect. The diff on <a href="https://cssbattle.dev" class="link">CSS
                    battle</a> kept showing a thin line where my creation did not match the original image. I tinkered
                with it for a long time, but had to settle for less than perfection this time.
