            <p>When looking at this design, it appeared to me as two overlapping squares with one at a 45
                degree angle to the other. At first I thought these squares would be the same size and have the same
                border thickness. I later realized that the square at an angle would have to have a thinner border,
                otherwise the inside of that border would overlap and change the shape of the blue square in the center.
