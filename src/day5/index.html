        <!-- This looked deceptively simple. Maybe it was simple, I just struggled. I thought I'd use grid, but it didn't work out like I thought. I probably needed to define columns, rows and grid-template-areas, now that I think about it. I ended up using flex box for a top container and a bottom container. Each column looked to be the same width and with the same gap between each one, but for some reason I would be off a pixel or two on various sides of the column. It was strange. This design also played tricks on my eyes. Was it actually an optical illusion?! -->
